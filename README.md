Hi, I’m ThomasU, retired for almost 10 years. Began to learn Python in December 2023.
I’m interested in playing musical instruments, and yet trying to learn new things.
I’m currently learning Python in Udemy. I have some basic concepts of programming. 
Back to about 30 years ago, I've learnt to write simple programs with Basic, Pascal, Cobol, Foxpro...
For the last 20 years, I played drum in church-band.
Now I am trying to make myself a real programmer so that I might be able to earn some money.
The school fee for my son to University is Hiiiiiiigh !
